  abstract  = {Meshless methods (MMs) were introduced in the late 1970s to solve problems in astrophysics. In MMs the spatial domain is represented by a set of nodes (cloud of points) and not discretized by elements as in most of the mesh-based methods (finite difference method, finite element method, finite volume method); consequently, there is no need for predefined connectivity between the nodes. In this chapter we are going to give an overview of applications, advantages, and disadvantages of various MMs developed and applied in the context of computational biomechanics. Strong and weak formulations will be presented, focusing on the novel interpolation schemes such as modified moving least squares and discretization correction particle strength exchange method, along with the meshless total Lagrangian explicit dynamics method. The applicability of the methods in multiscale problems and their inherent parallelization will be depicted through various applications, along with their advantages over the traditional mesh-based numerical methods. MMs can be considered as mainstream numerical methods able to tackle demanding engineering applications. Intensive and rigorous research in the field will make MMs robust enough to be used by industry.},

The proposed scheme is used for the numerical solution of the steady state, incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in their primitive variable (u-v-w-p) formulation. The governing equations are solved in their strong form using either a collocated or a semi-staggered type meshless nodal configuration. The unknown field functions and derivatives are calculated using the Modified Moving Least Squares (MMLS) interpolation method. Both velocity-correction and pressure-correction methods applied ensure the incompressibility constraint and mass conservation. The proposed meshless point collocation (MPC) scheme has the following characteristics: (i) it can be applied, in a straightforward manner to: steady, unsteady, internal and external fluid flows in 2D and 3D, (ii) it equally applies to regular an irregular geometries, (iii) a distribution of points is sufficient, no numerical integration in space nor any mesh structure are required, (iv) there is no need for pressure boundary conditions since no pressure constitutive equation is solved, (v) it is quite simple and accurate, (vi) results can be obtained using collocated or semi-staggered nodal distributions, (vii) there is no need to compute the velocity potential nor the unit normal vectors and (viii) there is no need for a curvilinear system of coordinates. Simulations of fluid flow in 2D and 3D for regular and irregular geometries indicate the validity of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {Abstract We propose a numerical method that combines the Finite Difference (FD) and strong form (collocation) Meshless Method (MM) for solving linear elasticity equations. We call this new method FDMCM. The FDMCM scheme uses a uniform Cartesian grid embedded in complex geometries and applies both methods to calculate spatial derivatives. The spatial domain is represented by a set of nodes categorized as i) boundary and near boundary nodes, and ii) interior nodes. For boundary and near boundary nodes, where the finite difference stencil cannot be defined, the Discretization Corrected Particle Strength Exchange (DC PSE) scheme is used for derivative evaluation, while for interior nodes standard second order Finite Differences are used. FDMCM method combines the advantages of both FD and DC PSE methods. It supports a fast and simple generation of grids and provides convergence rates comparable to weak formulations. We demonstrate the appropriateness and robustness of the proposed scheme through various benchmark problems in 2D and 3D. Numerical results show good accuracy and h- convergence properties. The ease of computational grid generation makes the method particularly suited for problems where geometries are very complicated and known only imperfectly from images, frequently occurring in e.g. geomechanics and patient-specific biomechanics, where the proposed FDMCM method, after its extension to non-linear regime, appears to be a promising alternative to the traditional weak form-based numerical schemes used in the field.},

Specifically, the consistency and invariance properties for the MMLS are proven. We demonstrate that MMLS shape functions form a partition of unity and the MMLS approximation satisfies the patch test. The invariance properties are important for the accurate computation of the shape functions by using translation and scaling to a canonical domain. We compare the performance of the EFG method based on MMLS, which uses quadratic base functions, to the performance of the EFG method which uses classical MLS with linear base functions, using both 2D and 3D examples. In 2D we solve an elasticity problem which has an analytical solution (bending of a Timoshenko beam) while in 3D we solve an elasticity problem which has an exact finite element solution (unconstrained compression of a cube). We also solve a complex problem involving complicated geometry, non-linear material, large deformations and contacts. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the MMLS over classical MLS in terms of solution accuracy, while shape functions can be computed using the same nodal distribution and support domain size for both methods.},

Imposing EBC is a fundamental issue in MMs. The imposition of prescribed displacement values on the boundary in MMs based on approximating shape functions is not as straightforward as in the Finite Element Method (FEM) because the meshless shape functions are generally not interpolating at nodes. Furthermore, many techniques of enforcing EBC are not compatible with explicit time integration schemes. This paper describes a new method of imposing EBC in EFG based MMs suitable for explicit time integration, named Essential Boundary Conditions Imposition in Explicit Meshless (EBCIEM). The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using both 2D and 3D numerical examples.},

It is a symptomless condition that, if left untreated, can expand until rupture. Despite ongoing efforts, an efficient tool for accurate estimation of AAA rupture risk is still not available.

Except semi-automatic segmentation of the AAA and intraluminal thrombus (ILT) from medical images, the entire analysis is performed automatically. The system is modular and easily expandable, allows the extraction of information from images of different modalities (e.g. CT and MRI) and the simulation of different modelling scenarios (e.g. with/without thrombus). The software uses contemporary methods that eliminate the need for patient-specific material properties, overcoming perhaps the key limitation to all previous patient-specific analysis methods. The software system is robust, free, and will allow researchers to perform comparative evaluation of AAA using a standardised approach. We report preliminary data from 48 cases.},

This paper investigates the application of adaptive integration in element-free Galerkin methods for solving problems in structural and solid mechanics in order to obtain accurate reference solutions.

Design/methodology/approach

An adaptive quadrature algorithm which allows user control over integration accuracy, previously developed for integrating boundary value problems, is adapted to elasticity problems. The algorithm allows the development of a convergence study procedure that takes into account both integration and discretisation errors. The convergence procedure is demonstrated using an elasticity problem which has an analytical solution and is then applied to accurately solve a soft tissue extension problem involving large deformations.

Findings

The developed convergence procedure, based on the presented adaptive integration scheme, allows the computation of accurate reference solutions for challenging problems which do not have an analytical or finite element solution.

Practical implications

The convergence procedure proposed in this paper allows the user to independently examine and control the contribution of integration and discretisation errors to the overall solution error. The presented procedure allows the computation of reference solutions for very challenging problems which do not have an analytical or even a finite element solution (such as very large deformation problems).

Originality/value

This paper investigates the application of adaptive quadrature to solid mechanics problems in engineering analysis using the element-free Galerkin method in order to obtain accurate reference solutions. The proposed convergence procedure allows the user to independently examine and control the contribution of integration and discretisation errors to the overall solution error. This allows the computation of reference solutions for very challenging problems which do not have an analytical or even a finite element solution (such as very large deformation problems).},

  abstract = {Aneurysms of the common iliac artery (CIAA) are typically found in association with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Isolated CIAAs, in the absence of an AAA, are uncommon. Similar to AAAs, CIAA may develop intraluminal thrombus (ILT). As isolated CIAAs have a contralateral common iliac artery for comparison, they provide an opportunity to study the hemodynamic mechanisms behind ILT formation.In this study, we compared a large isolated CIAA and the contralateral iliac artery using computational fluid dynamics to determine if hemodynamic metrics correlate with the location of ILT. We performed a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics study and investigated the residence time of platelets and monocytes, velocity fields, time-averaged wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index, and endothelial cell activation potential. We then correlated these data to ILT burden determined with computed tomography.We found that high cell residence times, low time-averaged wall shear stress, high oscillatory shear index, and high endothelial cell activation potential all correlate with regions of ILT development. Our results show agreement with previous hypotheses of thrombus formation in AAA and provide insights into the computational hemodynamics of iliac artery aneurysms.},

The level of artery wall detail in CFD models is expected to underpin predictions of plaque deposition, as it influences the computation of WSS. In this study, the sensitivity of WSS computation to geometric variation in a (proximally) stented left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery geometry is investigated. The geometry is reconstructed from intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, which are registered and merged with computed tomography (CT) to include surrounding arteries. The WSS is modelled for low-, medium- and high-resolution geometries; created by altering the point resolution of the contour algorithm used to trace the (OCT imaged) artery lumen. The results show that areas of low WSS (and thus high thrombotic susceptibility) in the stented portion of the artery depended greatly on the resolution of the geometric reconstruction. Compared with the high-resolution geometry, the low- and medium-resolutions failed to accurately determine the areas of low WSS in the stented region, as minor geometric features were inadequately represented. The sensitivity of WSS to geometric variation is also relevant to analyses using coronary artery geometries derived from other imaging modalities (particularly those of lower resolution than OCT).},

  abstract  = {Vascular inflammation is an established marker of cardiovascular pathogenesis, particularly atherosclerosis, but its role on arterial tissue biomechanics is not well understood. Its impact on the biomechanics of the aorta can yield valuable data for elucidating its role in disease formation, as well as leading to the development of valuable predictive models for surgery and new treatments. Changes in arterial biomechanics can lead to arterial remodelling and dysfunction, and so its quantification can provide insight into the nature of inflammatory processes. To gain further insight into these processes we investigated the biomechanical behaviour of lamb aortas from inflamed and control groups through the development of a constitutive model. The development of reliable constitutive models of the artery is necessary in order to fully understand the mechanical component of cardiovascular disease pathogenesis and vascular remodelling.

We used a foetal sheep model of systemic inflammation induced by prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (n = 6) to investigate the effects of short-term inflammation on the passive biomechanical response of the aorta. We subjected samples cut from aortas (LPS, n = 6; control, n = 4) to uniaxial tension testing until failure, measuring vessel dimensions and force–displacement curves.

Upon calibration of a first order Ogden model to fit the data, a difference was found in the μ parameter (4.43 × 10−4 ± 3.67 × 10−4 control, 7.77 × 10−4 ± 6.96 × 10−4 LPS-treated) and no difference was noted in the α parameter (12.96 ± 2.145 control, 12.65 ± 3.378 LPS-treated), although neither finding was statistically significant (p > 0.4, p > 0.8, respectively). Our preliminary ex-vivo data suggests that intra-amniotic LPS-induced systemic inflammation does not significantly change the stiffness or strength of the aorta. With further work, we hope our study can help fully elucidate the role of inflammation on aorta biomechanics.},

Four approaches for modelling of the brain-skull interface and two constitutive models (linear viscoelastic and Odgen hyperviscoelastic) of the brain tissue were employed in computer simulations of the experiments reported in the literature. Comparison of the predicted and experimentally determined magnitude and shape of trajectories of selected points within the brain as well as the maximum principal and shear strain within the brain was conducted. The comparison indicates that the predicted brain responses were strongly affected by both analysed factors. The results suggest that accurate prediction of brain deformations due to violent impact requires a model of the brain-skull interface that allows for movement between the brain outer surface and skull, while preventing complete separation between the brain and skull, and constitutive model that accounts for non-linear stress-strain relationship of the brain tissues.},

  abstract    = {Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a permanent and irreversible dilation of the lower region of the aorta. It is a symptomless condition that if left untreated can expand to the point of rupture. Mechanically-speaking, rupture of an artery occurs when the local wall stress exceeds the local wall strength. It is therefore desirable to be able to non-invasively estimate the AAA wall stress for a given patient, quickly and reliably. In this paper we present an entirely new approach to computing the wall tension (i.e. the stress resultant equal to the integral of the stresses tangent to the wall over the wall thickness) within an AAA that relies on trivial linear elastic finite element computations, which can be performed instantaneously in the clinical environment on the simplest computing hardware. As an input to our calculations we only use information readily available in the clinic: the shape of the aneurysm in-vivo, as seen on a computed tomography (CT) scan, and blood pressure. We demonstrate that tension fields computed with the proposed approach agree well with those obtained using very sophisticated, state-of-the-art non-linear inverse procedures. Using magnetic resonance (MR) images of the same patient, we can approximately measure the local wall thickness and calculate the local wall stress. What is truly exciting about this simple approach is that one does not need any information on material parameters; this supports the development and use of patient-specific modelling (PSM), where uncertainty in material data is recognised as a key limitation. The methods demonstrated in this paper are applicable to other areas of biomechanics where the loads and loaded geometry of the system are known.},

  abstract    = {Patient-specific biomechanical models have been advocated as a tool for predicting deformations of soft body organs/tissue for medical image registration (aligning two sets of images) when differences between the images are large. However, complex and irregular geometry of the body organs makes generation of patient-specific biomechanical models very time consuming. Meshless discretisation has been proposed to solve this challenge. However, applications so far have been limited to 2-D models and computing single organ deformations. In this study, 3-D comprehensive patient-specific non-linear biomechanical models implemented using Meshless Total Lagrangian Explicit Dynamics (MTLED) algorithms are applied to predict a 3-D deformation field for whole-body image registration. Unlike a conventional approach which requires dividing (segmenting) the image into non-overlapping constituents representing different organs/tissues, the mechanical properties are assigned using the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm without the image segmentation. Verification indicates that the deformations predicted using the proposed meshless approach are for practical purposes the same as those obtained using the previously validated finite element models. To quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the predicted deformations, we determined the spatial misalignment between the registered (i.e. source images warped using the predicted deformations) and target images by computing the edge-based Hausdorff distance. The Hausdorff distance-based evaluation determines that our meshless models led to successful registration of the vast majority of the image features.},

  abstract    = {The woman pelvic system involves multiple organs, muscles, ligaments, and fasciae where different pathologies may occur. Here we are most interested in abnormal mobility, often caused by complex and not fully understood mechanisms. Computer simulation and modeling using the finite element (FE) method are the tools helping to better understand the pathological mobility, but of course patient-specific models are required to make contribution to patient care. These models require a good representation of the pelvic system geometry, information on the material properties, boundary conditions and loading. In this contribution we focus on the relative influence of the inaccuracies in geometry description and of uncertainty of patient-specific material properties of soft connective tissues. We conducted a comparative study using several constitutive behavior laws and variations in geometry description resulting from the imprecision of clinical imaging and image analysis. We find that geometry seems to have the dominant effect on the pelvic organ mobility simulation results. Provided that proper finite deformation non-linear FE solution procedures are used, the influence of the functional form of the constitutive law might be for practical purposes negligible. These last findings confirm similar results from the fields of modeling neurosurgery and abdominal aortic aneurysms.},

  abstract    = {Rib fracture is one of the most common thoracic injuries in vehicle traffic accidents that can result in fatalities associated with seriously injured internal organs. A failure model is critical when modelling rib fracture to predict such injuries. Different rib failure models have been proposed in prediction of thorax injuries. However, the biofidelity of the fracture failure models when varying the loading conditions and the effects of a rib fracture failure model on prediction of thoracic injuries have been studied only to a limited extent. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of three rib failure models on prediction of thoracic injuries using a previously validated finite element model of the human thorax. The performance and biofidelity of each rib failure model were first evaluated by modelling rib responses to different loading conditions in two experimental configurations: (1) the three-point bending on the specimen taken from rib and (2) the anterior-posterior dynamic loading to an entire bony part of the rib. Furthermore, the simulation of the rib failure behaviour in the frontal impact to an entire thorax was conducted at varying velocities and the effects of the failure models were analysed with respect to the severity of rib cage damages. Simulation results demonstrated that the responses of the thorax model are similar to the general trends of the rib fracture responses reported in the experimental literature. However, they also indicated that the accuracy of the rib fracture prediction using a given failure model varies for different loading conditions.},

Direct examination of brain–skull interface is difficult due to its delicate nature and complex geometry that follows the skull and brain surface. Hence, we conducted uniaxial compression tests on samples containing skull, meninges and brain. We combined sophisticated measurement data with non-linear finite element analysis to obtain the properties of brain–skull interface. Skull was considered a rigid object as forces obtained were very small to induce any measurable deformation on it. Surface contact model between brain and skull was used to simulate the brain–skull interface. Good correlation between sample deformation in experiment and simulation was used to confirm the brain–skull interface property.},

  abstract  = {In applications where the organic soft tissue undergoes large deformations, traditional finite element methods can fail due to element distortion. In this context, meshless methods, which require no mesh for defining the interpolation field, can offer stable solutions. In meshless method, the moving least square (MLS) shape functions have been widely used for approximating the unknown field functions using the scattered field nodes. However, the classical MLS places strict requirements on the nodal distributions inside the support domain in order to maintain the non-singularity of the moment matrix. These limitations are preventing the practical use of higher order polynomial basis in classical MLS for randomly distributed nodes despite their capability for more accurate approximation of complex deformation fields. A modified moving least squares (MMLS) approximation has been recently developed by ISML. This paper assesses the interpolation capabilities of the MMLS. The proposed meshless method based on MMLS is used for computing the extension of a soft tissue sample and for a brain deformation simulation in 2D. The results are compared with the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the MMLS over classical MLS with linear basis functions in terms of accuracy of the solution.},

  abstract    = {To enhance neuro-navigation, high quality pre-operative images must be registered onto intra-operative configuration of the brain. Therefore evaluation of the degree to which structures may remain misaligned after registration is critically important. We consider two Hausdorff Distance (HD)-based evaluation approaches: the edge-based HD (EBHD) metric and the Robust HD (RHD) metric as well as various commonly used intensity-based similarity metrics such as Mutual Information (MI), Normalised Mutual Information (NMI), Entropy Correlation Coefficient (ECC), Kullback-Leibler Distance (KLD) and Correlation Ratio (CR). We conducted the evaluation by applying known deformations to simple sample images and real cases of brain shift. We conclude that the intensity-based similarity metrics such as MI, NMI, ECC, KLD and CR do not correlate well with actual alignment errors, and hence are not useful for assessing misalignment. On the contrary, the EBHD and the RHD metrics correlated well with actual alignment errors; however, they have been found to underestimate the actual misalignment. We also note that it is beneficial to present HD results as a percentile-HD curve rather than a single number such as the 95-percentile HD. Percentile-HD curves present the full range of alignment errors and also facilitate the comparison of results obtained using different approaches. Furthermore, the qualities that should be possessed by an ideal evaluation metric were highlighted. Future studies could focus on developing such an evaluation metric.},

  abstract    = {Whole-body computed tomography (CT) image registration is important for cancer diagnosis, therapy planning and treatment. Such registration requires accounting for large differences between source and target images caused by deformations of soft organs/tissues and articulated motion of skeletal structures. The registration algorithms relying solely on image processing methods exhibit deficiencies in accounting for such deformations and motion. We propose to predict the deformations and movements of body organs/tissues and skeletal structures for whole-body CT image registration using patient-specific non-linear biomechanical modelling. Unlike the conventional biomechanical modelling, our approach for building the biomechanical models does not require time-consuming segmentation of CT scans to divide the whole body into non-overlapping constituents with different material properties. Instead, a Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm is used for tissue classification to assign the constitutive properties automatically at integration points of the computation grid. We use only very simple segmentation of the spine when determining vertebrae displacements to define loading for biomechanical models. We demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach on CT images of seven patients suffering from cancer and aortic disease. The results confirm that accurate whole-body CT image registration can be achieved using a patient-specific non-linear biomechanical model constructed without time-consuming segmentation of the whole-body images.},

Explicit time integration with adaptive dynamic relaxation is used to compute the steady state solution. The algorithm can easily handle geometric and material nonlinearities, and is very efficient because it allows pre-computation of important solution parameters and does not require solution of large systems of equations. Swelling and shrinking behaviour is modelled by applying a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient to separate the total deformation into swelling/shrinking and elastic components. A hyperelastic constitutive law is used to model the elastic behaviour of the material. Accuracy of the algorithm is confirmed by successful verification against an established FE code. The algorithm involves only vector operations and is well suited for parallel implementation for increased computational speed.},

The aim of this work is to determine if AAAs expand and develop intraluminal thrombus (ILT) in regions of low wall shear stress (WSS) predicted with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Computed tomography (CT) data of an AAA was acquired at four time-points over 2.5 years, from the time of detection to immediately prior to rupture. We used 3D unsteady, laminar, CFD models to investigate the hemodynamics at each time-point. Our three-dimensional reconstructions showed that the primary region of expansion was in the proximal lobe, which not only coincided with the main region of low time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) in our CFD simulations, but also with the development of ILT in vivo. Interestingly, this region was also the rupture location. This is the first serial computational study of an AAA and the work has shown the potential of CFD to model the changing hemodynamics and the relation with ILT development and AAA growth.},

  abstract    = {It is possible to improve neuronavigation during image-guided surgery by warping the high-quality preoperative brain images so that they correspond with the current intraoperative configuration of the brain. In this paper, the accuracy of registration results obtained using comprehensive biomechanical models is compared with the accuracy of rigid registration, the technology currently available to patients. This comparison allows investigation into whether biomechanical modeling provides good-quality image data for neuronavigation for a larger proportion of patients than rigid registration. Preoperative images for 33 neurosurgery cases were warped onto their respective intraoperative configurations using both the biomechanics-based method and rigid registration. The Hausdorff distance-based evaluation process, which measures the difference between images, was used to quantify the performance of both registration methods. A statistical test for difference in proportions was conducted to evaluate the null hypothesis that the proportion of patients for whom improved neuronavigation can be achieved is the same for rigid and biomechanics-based registration. The null hypothesis was confidently rejected (p < 10(-4)). Even the modified hypothesis that fewer than 25\% of patients would benefit from the use of biomechanics-based registration was rejected at a significance level of 5\% (p = 0.02). The biomechanics-based method proved particularly effective in cases demonstrating large craniotomy-induced brain deformations. The outcome of this analysis suggests that nonlinear biomechanics-based methods are beneficial to a large proportion of patients and can be considered for use in the operating theater as a possible means of improving neuronavigation and surgical outcomes.},

Shortcomings of such mesh-based discretisation in modelling of surgical cutting include high computational cost and the need for re-meshing in the vicinity of cutting-induced discontinuity. The meshless total Lagrangian adaptive dynamic relaxation (MTLADR) algorithm we present here does not exhibit such shortcomings, as it relies on spatial discretisation in a form of a cloud of nodes. The cutting-induced discontinuity is modelled solely through changes in nodal domains of influence, which is done through efficient implementation of the visibility criterion using the level set method.

  abstract  = {Non-rigid registration algorithms that align source and target images play an important role in image-guided surgery and diagnosis. For problems involving large differences between images, such as registration of whole-body radiographic images, biomechanical models have been proposed in recent years. Biomechanical registration has been dominated by Finite Element Method (FEM). In practice, major drawback of FEM is a long time required to generate patient-specific finite element meshes and divide (segment) the image into non-overlapping constituents with different material properties. We eliminate time-consuming mesh generation through application of Meshless Total Lagrangian Explicit Dynamics (MTLED) algorithm that utilises a computational grid in a form of cloud of points. To eliminate the need for segmentation, we use fuzzy tissue classification algorithm to assign the material properties to meshless grid. Comparison of the organ contours in the registered (i.e. source image warped using deformations predicted by our patient-specific meshless model) and target images indicate that our meshless approach facilitates accurate registration of whole-body images with local misalignments of up to only two voxels.},

  abstract  = {Registration of whole-body radiographic images is an important task in analysis of the disease progression and assessment of responses to therapies. Numerous registration algorithms have been successfully used in applications where differences between source and target images are relatively small. However, registration of whole-body CT scans remains extremely challenging for such algorithms as it requires taking large deformations of body organs and articulated skeletal motions into account. For registration problems involving large differences between source and target images, registration using biomechanical models has been recommended in the literature. Therefore, in this study, we propose a patient-specific nonlinear finite element model to predict the movements and deformations of body organs for the whole-body CT image registration. We conducted a verification example in which a patient-specific torso model was implemented using a suite of nonlinear finite element algorithms we previously developed, verified and successfully used in neuroimaging registration. When defining the patient-specific geometry for the generation of computational grid for our model, we abandoned the time-consuming hard segmentation of radiographic images typically used in patient-specific biomechanical modelling to divide the body into non-overlapping constituents with different material properties. Instead, an automated Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm for tissue classification was applied to assign the constitutive properties at finite element mesh integration points. The loading was defined as a prescribed displacement of the vertebrae (treated as articulated rigid bodies) between the two CT images. Contours of the abdominal organs obtained by warping the source image using the deformation field within the body predicted using our patient-specific finite element model differed by only up to only two voxels from the actual organs’ contours in the target image. These results can be regarded as encouraging step in confirming feasibility of conducting accurate registration of whole-body CT images using nonlinear finite element models without the necessity for time-consuming image segmentation when building patient-specific finite element meshes.},

  abstract    = {Biomechanical modeling methods can be used to predict deformations for medical image registration and particularly, they are very effective for whole-body computed tomography (CT) image registration because differences between the source and target images caused by complex articulated motions and soft tissues deformations are very large. The biomechanics-based image registration method needs to deform the source images using the deformation field predicted by finite element models (FEMs). In practice, the global and local coordinate systems are used in finite element analysis. This involves the transformation of coordinates from the global coordinate system to the local coordinate system when calculating the global coordinates of image voxels for warping images. In this paper, we present an efficient numerical inverse isoparametric mapping algorithm to calculate the local coordinates of arbitrary points within the eight-noded hexahedral finite element. Verification of the algorithm for a nonparallelepiped hexahedral element confirms its accuracy, fast convergence, and efficiency. The algorithm's application in warping of the whole-body CT using the deformation field predicted by means of a biomechanical FEM confirms its reliability in the context of whole-body CT registration.},

One of the crucial steps in the process of image registration is assessment of its accuracy. The accuracy of an image registration procedure was evaluated in one of our previous studies, for five cases of neurosurgery, using a manual segmentation-based method that is subjective and prone to human errors. The aim of this study is to develop an evaluation method that is objective and automatic. An edge-based Hausdorff Distance (HD) metric based on Canny edges was developed for evaluation. Subsequently, the accuracy of non-rigid registration (NRR) results was evaluated using intra-operative images as ground truth and compared with those from the previous study. The obtained results compared well despite the differences in the methods employed. The edge-based HD metric provides an objective measure for image registration accuracy evaluation.},

In this paper, a meshless Total Lagrangian Adaptive Dynamic Relaxation (MTLADR) 3D cutting algorithm is proposed to predict the steady-state responses of soft tissue at any stage of surgical cutting in 3D. The MTLADR 3D algorithm features a spatial discretisation using a cloud of nodes.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever analysis of this kind. When conducting in situ indentation of the brain, the reaction force on the indentor was measured. After the indentation, a cylindrical sample of the brain tissue was extracted and subjected to uniaxial compression test. A model of the brain indentation experiment was built in the Finite Element (FE) solver ABAQUSâ„¢. In the model, the mechanical properties of the brain tissue were assigned as obtained from the uniaxial compression test and the brain-skull interface was modeled as linear springs. The interface stiffness (defined as sum of stiffnesses of the springs divided by the interface area) was varied to obtain good agreement between the calculated and experimentally measured indentor force-displacement relationship. Such agreement was found to occur for the brain-skull interface stiffness of 11.45 Nmmâ�»Â¹/mmÂ². This allowed identification of the overall mechanical properties of the brain-skull interface.},

We are witnessing an advent of patient-specific biomechanics that will bring in the future personalized treatments to sufferers all over the world. It is the current task of biomechanists to devise methods for clinically-relevant patient-specific modeling. One of the obstacles standing before the biomechanics community is the difficulty in obtaining patient-specific properties of tissues to be used in biomechanical models. We postulate that focusing on reformulating computational mechanics problems in such a way that the results are weakly sensitive to the variation in mechanical properties of simulated continua is more likely to bear fruit in near future. We consider two types of problems: (i) displacement-zero traction problems whose solutions in displacements are weakly sensitive to mechanical properties of the considered continuum; and (ii) problems that are approximately statically determinate and therefore their solutions in stresses are also weakly sensitive to mechanical properties of constituents. We demonstrate that the kinematically loaded biomechanical models of the first type are applicable in the field of image-guided surgery where the current, intraoperative configuration of a soft organ is of critical importance. We show that sac-like membranes, which are prototypes of many thin-walled biological organs, are approximately statically determinate and therefore useful solutions for wall stress can be obtained without the knowledge of the wall's properties. We demonstrate the clinical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods using examples from modeling neurosurgery and intracranial aneurysms.},

The qualitative and quantitative evaluations indicate that our biomechanics-based registration algorithm, despite using much less input data, has at least as high registration accuracy as that of the BSpline algorithm.},

  abstract    = {We model complete growth of an avascular tumour by employing cellular automata for the growth of cells and steady-state equation to solve for nutrient concentrations. Our modelling and computer simulation results show that, in the case of a brain tumour, oxygen distribution in the tumour volume may be sufficiently described by a time-independent steady-state equation without losing the characteristics of a time-dependent diffusion equation. This makes the solution of oxygen concentration in the tumour volume computationally more efficient, thus enabling simulation of tumour growth on a large scale. We solve this steady-state equation using a central difference method. We take into account the composition of cells and intercellular adhesion in addition to processes involved in cell cycle--proliferation, quiescence, apoptosis, and necrosis--in the tumour model. More importantly, we consider cell mutation that gives rise to different phenotypes and therefore a tumour with heterogeneous population of cells. A new phenotype is probabilistically chosen and has the ability to survive at lower levels of nutrient concentration and reproduce faster. We show that heterogeneity of cells that compose a tumour leads to its irregular growth and that avascular growth is not supported for tumours of diameter above 18â€‰mm. We compare results from our growth simulation with existing experimental data on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and tumour spheroid cultures and show that our results are in good agreement with the experimental findings.},

Most of the time, a finite element mesh is used for computing the deformation field. Although many papers discuss methods for obtaining the deformation field, there is little information on how it will be used, especially for updating images intraoperatively. In this paper, we discuss some requirements related to the use of this deformation field for warping high quality preoperative brain images. A software implementation is presented, which satisfies most of these requirements. Based on this implementation, we outline some of the difficulties in performing brain registration intraoperatively in real time and propose possible solutions.},

However, the difficulties with patient-specific computational grid generation prevent the widespread application of biomechanical modeling in medicine. For more efficient computational grid generation, we propose a statistical meshless model based on fuzzy tissue classification and mechanical property assignment, and meshless (i.e., based on the unstructured cloud of points that do not form elements) solution method. Instead of hard segmentation that divides intracranial area into nonoverlapping, constituent regions we use statistical classification to get the fuzzy membership functions of tissue classes for each voxel. Material properties are assigned to integration points based on this soft classification. Verification example shows that the proposed model gives equivalent results—difference in computed brain deformations of at most 0.2 mm—to the finite element method (FEM) and can certainly be considered for use in future simulations. Based on this concept, patient-specific computational models can be more efficiently and robustly generated in the clinical workflow.},

However, the pre-operative images can be warped to the intra-operative position of brain using predicted deformation field. While craniotomy-induced brain shift deformation can be accurately computed using patient-specific finite element models in real-time, accurate segmentation and meshing of brain internal structures remains a time-consuming task. In this chapter, we conduct a parametric study to evaluate the sensitivity of the predicted brain shift deformation to model complexity, which includes the effects of disregarding the differences in properties between the parenchyma, tumour and ventricles and applying different approaches for representing the ventricles (as a very soft solid or cavity) to minimise segmentation and meshing effort for model generation. The results suggest that the difference in brain shift deformation predicted by models due to such variation is not significant. Segmentation of brain parenchyma and skull seems sufficient to build models that can accurately predict craniotomy-induced brain shift deformation.},

Patient-specific biomechanical models have been applied in several studies when predicting the prostate intraoperative deformations for such warping. Obtaining exact patient-specific information about the stress parameter (e.g., Young’s modulus) of the prostate peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland (CG) for such models remains an unsolved problem. In this study, we investigated the effects of ratio of Young’s modulus of the central gland ECG to the peripheral zone EPZ when predicting the prostate intraoperative deformation for ten cases of prostate brachytherapy. The patient-specific prostate models were implemented by means of the specialized nonlinear finite element procedures that utilize total Lagrangian formulation and explicit integration in time domain. The loading was defined by prescribing deformations on the prostate outer surface. The neo-Hookean hyperelastic constitutive model was applied to simulate the PZ and CG mechanical responses. The PZ to CG Young’s modulus ratio ECG:EPZ was varied between 1:1 (upper bound of the literature data) and 1:40 (lower bound of the literature data). The study indicates that the predicted prostate intraoperative deformations and results of the prostate MRIs nonrigid registration obtained using the predicted deformations depend very weakly on the ECG:EPZ ratio.},

  abstract  = {This study investigated the hypothesis that changes in the brain vasculature system can explain the mechanics of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) growth. A generic 3-D mesh of a healthy human brain was created. We used a fully non-linear (geometric, constitutive and boundary conditions) 3-D model of the brain parenchyma. The brain parenchyma was modelled as a nearly incompressible, single-phase continuum. A hyperelastic constitutive law and finite deformation theory described the deformations within the brain parenchyma. The brain vasculature system was modelled biomechanically by modifying the relaxed shear modulus according to the cardiac cycle to produce a time varying shear modulus. As no study currently exists on the effects of vasculature on brain parenchyma material properties, a parametric investigation was conducted by varying the brain parenchyma relaxed shear modulus. It is widely believed that no more than 1 mm of Hg (133.416 Pa) transmantle pressure difference is associated with NPH. Hence, we loaded the brain parenchyma with 1 mm of Hg transmantle pressure difference to investigate this suggestion. Fully non-linear, implicit, quasi-static finite element procedures in the time domain were used to obtain the deformation of the brain parenchyma and the ventricles. The results of the simulations showed that 1 mm of Hg (133.416 Pa) did not produce the clinical condition of NPH, even with brain vasculature effects taken into account. We conclude from our work that it is highly unlikely for a phenomenon, such as the brain vasculature effects due to the cardiac cycle, which occurs many times a minute to be able to influence an event such as NPH which presents itself over a time scale of hours to days. We further suggest that the hypothesis of a purely mechanical basis for NPH growth needs to be revised.},

  abstract  = {In this chapter we present an algorithm for computing the displacement of the exposed surface of the brain during surgery. The motion of the cortical surface is recovered by registering the preoperative surface extracted from high-resolution MRI images to the intraoperative surface acquired during surgery. The recovered motion can then be used for driving a biomechanical model in order to predict the displacement of the internal brain structures, especially the tumor, which can be presented to the surgeon using an image-guided neurosurgery system. Our algorithm combines an image registration method with curvature information associated with the features of the brain surface to perform the non-rigid surface registration. The extracted displacement field can be used directly for driving a biomechanical model, as it does not include any implausible deformations. It also works in cases when the boundaries of the two registered surfaces are not identical, extracting the displacements only for the overlapping regions of the two surfaces. We tested the accuracy of the proposed algorithm using synthetically generated data as well as surfaces extracted from preoperative and intraoperative MRI images of the brain.},

  abstract  = {In this chapter, we evaluated the accuracy of non-linear FE modelling in application to surgical simulation. We compared experiment and FE modelling of indentation of the soft tissue phantom. The evaluation was done in terms of soft tissue phantom deformation and the forces acting on the indenter. The soft tissue phantom deformation was measured by tracking 3D motions of X-ray opaque markers placed in the direct neighbourhood under the indenter with a custom-built bi-plane X-ray image intensifiers (XRII) system. The modelling of soft tissue phantom indentation was conducted using the ABAQUS/standard finite element solver. Specific constitutive properties of the soft tissue phantom determined through semi-confined uniaxial compression tests were used in the model. The model accurately predicted the indentation force–displacement relations and marker displacements. The agreement between modelling and experimental results verifies the reliability of our FE modelling techniques and confirms the predictive power of these techniques in surgical simulation.},

We present selected topics in the area of mathematical and numerical modelling of the brain biomechanics for neurosurgical simulation and brain image registration. These processes can reasonably be described in purely mechanical terms, such as displacements, strains and stresses and therefore can be analysed using established methods of continuum mechanics. We advocate the use of fully non-linear theory of continuum mechanics. We discuss in some detail modelling geometry, boundary conditions, loading and material properties. We consider numerical problems such as the use of hexahedral and mixed hexahedral-tetrahedral meshes as well as meshless spatial discretisation schemes. We advocate the use of Total Lagrangian Formulation of both finite element and meshless methods together with explicit time-stepping procedures. We support our recommendations and conclusions with an example of brain shift computation for intraoperative image registration.},

This contribution presents real-time patient-specific computation of the deformation field within the brain for six cases of brain shift induced by craniotomy (i.e. surgical opening of the skull) using specialised non-linear finite element procedures implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU). In contrast to commercial finite element codes that rely on an updated Lagrangian formulation and implicit integration in time domain for steady state solutions, our procedures utilise the total Lagrangian formulation with explicit time stepping and dynamic relaxation. We used patient-specific finite element meshes consisting of hexahedral and non-locking tetrahedral elements, together with realistic material properties for the brain tissue and appropriate contact conditions at the boundaries. The loading was defined by prescribing deformations on the brain surface under the craniotomy. Application of the computed deformation fields to register (i.e. align) the preoperative and intraoperative images indicated that the models very accurately predict the intraoperative deformations within the brain. For each case, computing the brain deformation field took less than 4Â s using an NVIDIA Tesla C870 GPU, which is two orders of magnitude reduction in computation time in comparison to our previous study in which the brain deformation was predicted using a commercial finite element solver executed on a personal computer.},

Automatic hexahedral mesh generation for complex geometries remains a challenging problem, and therefore tetrahedral or mixed meshes are often necessary. Unfortunately the standard formulation of the linear tetrahedral element exhibits volumetric locking in case of almost incompressible materials. In this paper we extend the average nodal pressure tetrahedral element proposed by Bonet and Burton for a better handling of multiple material interfaces. The new formulation can handle multiple materials in a uniform way, with better accuracy, while requiring only a small additional computation effort. We discuss some implementation issues and show how easy an existing TLED (Total Lagrangian Explicit Dynamics) algorithm can be modified in order to support the new element formulation. The performance evaluation of the new element shows the clear improvement in reaction forces and displacements predictions compared to the average nodal pressure element in case of models consisting of multiple materials.},

This requires algorithms that are fast, accurate and can handle material nonlinearities and large deformations. A set of such algorithms is presented in this paper, starting with the finite element formulation and the integration scheme used and addressing common problems such as hourglass control and locking. The computation examples presented prove that by using these algorithms, real time computations become possible without sacrificing the accuracy of the results. For a brain model having more than 7,000 degrees of freedom, we computed the reaction forces due to indentation with frequency of around 1,000 Hz using a standard dual core PC. Similarly, we conducted simulation of brain shift using a model with more than 50,000 degrees of freedom in less than one minute. The speed benefits of our models result from combining the Total Lagrangian formulation with explicit time integration and low order finite elements.},

However, as we have shown in our previous work, high quality pre-operative images can be warped to the intra-operative position of the brain. This can be achieved by computing deformations within the brain using a biomechanical model. In this paper, using a previously developed patient-specific model of brain undergoing craniotomy-induced shift, we conduct a parametric analysis to investigate in detail the influences of constitutive models of the brain tissue. We conclude that the choice of the brain tissue constitutive model, when used with an appropriate finite deformation solution, does not affect the accuracy of computed displacements, and therefore a simple linear elastic model for the brain tissue is sufficient.},

  abstract    = {This study investigates the mechanics of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) growth using a computational approach. We created a generic 3-D brain mesh of a healthy human brain and modelled the brain parenchyma as single phase and biphasic continuum. In our model, hyperelastic constitutive law and finite deformation theory described deformations within the brain parenchyma. We used a value of 155.77Pa for the shear modulus (mu) of the brain parenchyma. Additionally, in our model, contact boundary definitions constrained the brain outer surface inside the skull. We used transmantle pressure difference to load the model. Fully nonlinear, implicit finite element procedures in the time domain were used to obtain the deformations of the ventricles and the brain. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first 3-D, fully nonlinear model investigating NPH growth mechanics. Clinicians generally accept that at most 1mm of Hg transmantle pressure difference (133.416Pa) is associated with the condition of NPH. Our computations showed that transmantle pressure difference of 1mm of Hg (133.416Pa) did not produce NPH for either single phase or biphasic model of the brain parenchyma. A minimum transmantle pressure difference of 1.764mm of Hg (235.44Pa) was required to produce the clinical condition of NPH. This suggested that the hypothesis of a purely mechanical basis for NPH growth needs to be revised. We also showed that under equal transmantle pressure difference load, there were no significant differences between the computed ventricular volumes for biphasic and incompressible/nearly incompressible single phase model of the brain parenchyma. As a result, there was no major advantage gained by using a biphasic model for the brain parenchyma. We propose that for modelling NPH, nearly incompressible single phase model of the brain parenchyma was adequate. Single phase treatment of the brain parenchyma simplified the mathematical description of the NPH model and resulted in significant reduction of computational time.},

  abstract    = {This study aimed to assess the ability of the laser scanning confocal arthroscope (LSCA) to evaluate cartilage microstructure, particularly in differentiating stages of human osteoarthritis (OA) as classified by the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) OA grade definitions.Ten tibial plateaus from total knee arthroplasty patients were obtained at the time of surgery. Cartilage areas were visually graded based on the ICRS classification, imaged by use of a 7-mm-diameter LSCA (488-nm excitation with 0.5\% [wt/vol] fluorescein, 20-minute staining period), and then removed with underlying bone for histologic examination with H&E staining. The 2 imaging techniques were then compared for each ICRS grade to ascertain similarity between the methods and thus gauge the techniques' diagnostic resolution. Cartilage surface degeneration was readily imaged and OA severity accurately gauged by the LSCA and confirmed by histology.LSCA and histologic images of specimens in the late stages of OA were seen to be mutually related even though they were imaged in planes that were orthogonal to each other. Useful and comparable diagnostic resolution was obtained in all imaged specimens from subjects with various stages of OA.This study showed the LSCA's ability to image detailed cartilage surface morphologic features that identify grade 1 through 4 of the ICRS OA grading system. The LSCA's imaging potential was best shown by its ability to resolve the fine collagen network present under the lamina splendens. The incorporation of high-magnification confocal technology within the confines of an arthroscopic probe has proved to provide the imaging requirements necessary to perform detailed cartilage condition assessment.In comparison to video arthroscopy, LSCA provides increased magnification along with improved contrast and resolution.},

Our method is meshless in the sense that deformation is calculated at nodes that are not part of an element mesh. Node placement is almost arbitrary. Fully geometrically nonlinear total Lagrangian formulation is used. Geometric integration is performed over a regular background grid that does not conform to the simulation geometry. Explicit time integration is used via the central difference method. To validate the method we simulate indentation of a swine brain and compare the results to experimental data.},

The previously developed framework consisted of a constitutive model capable of incorporating confocal image-derived tissue microstructural data. In the present paper (Part II) fibre and matrix constitutive parameters are first estimated from mechanical testing of a batch of specimens similar to, but independent from those under consideration. Image analysis techniques which allow estimation of tissue microstructural parameters form confocal images are presented. The constitutive model and image-derived structural parameters are then used to predict the reaction force history of the two meniscal specimens subjected to partially confined compression. The predictions are made on the basis of the specimens' individual structural condition as assessed by confocal microscopy and involve no tuning of material parameters. Although the model does not reproduce all features of the experimental curves, as an unfitted estimate of mechanical response the prediction is quite accurate. In light of the obtained results it is judged that more general non-invasive estimation of tissue mechanical properties is possible using the developed framework.},

  abstract    = {This contribution presents finite element computation of the deformation field within the brain during craniotomy-induced brain shift. The results were used to illustrate the capabilities of non-linear (i.e. accounting for both geometric and material non-linearities) finite element analysis in non-rigid registration of pre- and intra-operative magnetic resonance images of the brain. We used patient-specific hexahedron-dominant finite element mesh, together with realistic material properties for the brain tissue and appropriate contact conditions at boundaries. The model was loaded by the enforced motion of nodes (i.e. through prescribed motion of a boundary) at the brain surface in the craniotomy area. We suggest using explicit time-integration scheme for discretised equations of motion, as the computational times are much shorter and accuracy, for practical purposes, the same as in the case of implicit integration schemes. Application of the computed deformation field to register (i.e. align) the pre-operative images with the intra-operative ones indicated that the model very accurately predicts the displacements of the tumour and the lateral ventricles even for limited information about the brain surface deformation. The prediction accuracy improves when information about deformation of not only exposed (during craniotomy) but also unexposed parts of the brain surface is used when prescribing loading. However, it appears that the accuracy achieved using information only about the deformation of the exposed surface, that can be determined without intra-operative imaging, is acceptable. The presented results show that non-linear biomechanical models can complement medical image processing techniques when conducting non-rigid registration. Important advantage of such models over the previously used linear ones is that they do not require unrealistic assumptions that brain deformations are infinitesimally small and brain stress-strain relationship is linear.},

The brain tissue is considered as a single phase continuum undergoing finite deformations. A non-linear constitutive model of the brain tissue is used. Precise geometrical model of the brain is obtained from MRI images and the brain mesh is created.

  abstract    = {Metal baseball bats have been experimentally demonstrated to produce higher ball exit velocity (BEV) than wooden bats. In the United States, all bats are subject to BEV tests using hitting machines that rotate the bat in a horizontal plane. In this paper, a model of bat-ball impact was developed based on 3-D translational and rotational kinematics of a swing performed by high-level players. The model was designed to simulate the maximal performance of specific models of a wooden bat and a metal bat when swung by a player, and included material properties and kinematics specific to each bat. Impact dynamics were quantified using the finite element method (ANSYS/LSDYNA, version 6.1). Maximum BEV from both a metal (61.5 m/s) and a wooden (50.9 m/s) bat exceeded the 43.1 m/s threshold by which bats are certified as appropriate for commercial sale. The lower BEV from the wooden bat was attributed to a lower pre-impact bat linear velocity, and a more oblique impact that resulted in a greater proportion of BEV being lost to lateral and vertical motion. The results demonstrate the importance of factoring bat linear velocity and spatial orientation into tests of maximal bat performance, and have implications for the design of metal baseball bats.},

Traditional approaches have treated such tissues as continua and have described their mechanical response in terms of macroscopic models borrowed from solid mechanics. The most important of such models are the biphasic and single-phase viscoelastic models, and the many variations thereof. These models have reached a high level of maturity and have been successful in describing a wide range of phenomena. An alternative approach that has received considerable recent interest, both in orthopedic biomechanics and in other fields, is the description of mechanical response based on consideration of a tissue's structure--so-called microstructural modeling. Examples of microstructurally based approaches include fibril-reinforced biphasic models and homogenization approaches. A review of both macroscopic and microstructural constitutive models is given in the present work.},

  abstract    = {Mechanical properties of very soft tissues, such as brain, liver, kidney and prostate have recently joined the mainstream research topics in biomechanics. This has happened in spite of the fact that these tissues do not bear mechanical loads. The interest in the biomechanics of very soft tissues has been motivated by the developments in computer-integrated and robot-aided surgery--in particular, the emergence of automatic surgical tools and robots-as well as advances in virtual reality techniques. Mechanical testing of very soft tissues provides a formidable challenge for an experimenter. Very soft tissues are usually tested in compression using an unconfined compression set-up, which requires ascertaining that friction between sample faces and stress-strain machine platens is close to zero. In this paper a more reliable method of testing is proposed. In the proposed method top and bottom faces of a cylindrical specimen with low aspect ratio are rigidly attached to the platens of the stress-strain machine (e.g. using surgical glue). This arrangement allows using a no-slip boundary condition in the analysis of the results. Even though the state of deformation in the sample cannot be treated as orthogonal the relationships between total change of height (measured) and strain are obtained. Two important results are derived: (i) deformed shape of a cylindrical sample subjected to uniaxial compression is independent on the form of constitutive law, (ii) vertical extension in the plane of symmetry lambda(z) is proportional to the total change of height for strains as large as 30\%. The importance and relevance of these results to testing procedures in biomechanics are highlighted.},

  abstract  = {Many modern applications of technology to medicine, such as robotic surgery, non-rigid registration, virtual reality operation planning and surgeon training systems, and surgical simulators, require knowledge of mechanical properties of very soft tissues. In this paper we describe and identify a model of mechanical properties of brain tissue aimed in particular at integration with interactive brain atlases. A non-linear, viscoelastic model based on the generalization of the Ogden strain energy hyperelastic constitutive equation is proposed. The material parameters are identified using in-vivo experimental results. The model accounts well for brain tissue deformation behavior in both tension and compression (natural strain ε〈 − 0.3, 0.2〉 ) for strain rates typical for surgical procedures. It can be immediately applied in large-scale finite element simulations and, therefore, offers the possibility of incorporating mechanics into surgical planning and training systems such as NeuroPlanner and BrainBench. Finally we show that the brain model identified based on in-vivo experiments can be applied in the more realistic in-vivo setting.},

  abstract    = {Metal baseball bats produce higher ball exit velocity (BEV) than wood bats, increasing the risk of impact injuries to infield players. In this paper, maximum BEV from a wood and a metal bat were determined using the finite element method.Three-dimensional (3-D) bat kinematics at the instant of impact were determined from high-speed videography (N = 17 high-performance batters). A linear viscoelastic constitutive model was developed for stiffer and softer types of baseballs. The risk of impact injury was determined using available movement time data for adult pitchers; the data indicate that 0.400 s is required to evade a batted ball.The highest BEV (61.5 m.s(-1)) was obtained from the metal bat and the stiffer ball model, equating to 0.282 s of available movement time. For five impacts along the long axis of each bat, the "best case scenario" resulted from the wood bat and the softer ball (46.0 m.s(-1), 0.377 s).The performance difference between the bats was attributed to the preimpact linear velocity of the bat impact point and to differences in orientation on the horizontal plane. Reducing the swing moment of the baseball bat, and the shear and relaxation modulii of the baseball, increased the available movement time.},

  abstract    = {Regulating ball response to impact is one way to control ball exit velocity in baseball. This is necessary to reduce injuries to defensive players and maintain the balance between offense and defense in the game. This paper presents a model for baseball velocity-dependent behavior. Force-displacement data were obtained using quasi-static compression tests to 50\% of ball diameter (n = 70 baseballs). The force-displacement curves for a very stiff baseball (Model B) and a softer type (Model C) were characterized by a Mooney-Rivlin model using implicit finite element analysis (ANSYS software, version 6.1). Agreement between experimental and numerical results was excellent for both Model B (C(10) = 0, C(01) = 3.7e(6) Pa) and Model C (C(10) = 0, C(01) = 2.6e(6) Pa). However, this material model was not available in the ANSYS/LSDYNA explicit dynamic software (version 6.1) used to quantify the transient behavior of the ball. Therefore the modeling process was begun again using a linear viscoelastic material. G(infinity), the long-term shear modulus of the material, was determined by the same implicit FEA procedure. Explicit FEA was used to quantify the time-dependent response of each ball in terms of instantaneous shear modulus (G0) and a decay term (beta). The results were evaluated with respect to published experimental data for the ball coefficient of restitution at five velocities (13.4-40.2 ms(-1)) and were in agreement with the experimental values. The model forms the basis for future research on baseball response to impact with the bat.},

  abstract  = {In the present study, fully nonlinear (i.e. accounting for both geometric and material nonlinearities) patient specific finite element brain model was applied to predict deformation field within the brain during the craniotomy-induced brain shift. Deformation of brain surface was used as displacement boundary conditions. Application of the computed deformation field to align (i.e. register) the preoperative images with the intraoperative ones indicated that the model very accurately predicts the displacements of gravity centers of the lateral ventricles and tumor even for very limited information about the brain surface deformation. These results are sufficient to suggest that nonlinear biomechanical models can be regarded as one possible way of complementing medical image processing techniques when conducting nonrigid registration. Important advantage of such models over the linear ones is that they do not require unrealistic assumptions that brain deformations are infinitesimally small and brain tissue stress–strain relationship is linear.},

This paper will review the incidence and causal factors for impact injuries in baseball. Attention is given to the design and material properties of bats, in light of evidence suggesting balls hit into the infield from metal bats can reach velocities potentially lethal to defensive players. The distribution of bat mass along the long axis of the implement appears a major factor in the greater performance potential of metal bats over wooden bats of equal length and mass. The dynamic behaviour of baseballs has also been implicated in the severity of head and chest injuries experienced by players. Balls of greatly reduced stiffness have been introduced for junior play, but debate still remains over their performance and impact characteristics. The behaviour of the ball during high-speed impact with the bat has been the subject of relatively limited research, and the effect of manipulating baseball material properties to decrease batted-ball velocity is unclear. The value of batting helmets is evident in the observed reduction of head injuries in baseball, but the use of protective vests to decrease the incidence and severity of cardio-thoracic trauma appears to be contraindicated.},

In particular, finite element analyses and other powerful computational methods have long been used to provide quantitative results in the investigation of dynamic processes such as head trauma. Nevertheless, the potential of these methods to simulate and predict the outcome of quasi-static processes such as neurosurgical procedures and neuropathological processes has only recently been explored. Some inherent difficulties in modeling brain tissues, which have impeded progress, are discussed in this work. The behavior of viscoelastic and poroelastic constitutive models is compared in simple 1-D simulations using the ABAQUS finite element platform. In addition, the behaviors of quasi-static brain constitutive models that have recently been proposed are compared. We conclude that a compressible viscoelastic solid model may be the most appropriate for modeling neurosurgical procedures.},

  abstract    = {This paper contains experimental results of in vitro, uniaxial tension of swine brain tissue in finite deformation as well as proposes a new hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model for the brain tissue. The experimental results obtained for two loading velocities, corresponding to strain rates of 0.64 and 0.64 x 10(-2)s(-1), are presented. We believe that these are the first ever experiments of this kind. The applied strain rates were similar to those applied in our previous study, focused on explaining brain tissue properties in compression. The stress-strain curves are convex downward for all extension rates. The tissue response stiffened as the loading speed increased, indicating a strong stress-strain rate dependence. Swine brain tissue was found to be considerably softer in extension than in compression. Previously proposed in the literature brain tissue constitutive models, developed based on experimental data collected in compression are shown to be inadequate to explain tissue behaviour in tension. A new, non-linear, viscoelastic model based on the generalisation of the Ogden strain energy hyper-elastic constitutive equation is proposed. The new model accounts well for brain tissue deformation behaviour in both tension and compression (natural strain in <-0.3,0.2>) for strain rates ranging over five orders of magnitude.},

  abstract  = {An optimal kinematic design method suited for parallel manipulators is developed. The kinematic optimization process yields a design, which delivers the best compromise between manipulability and a new performance index, space utilization. It is shown that the exhaustive search minimization algorithm is effective for as many as four independent design variables and presents a viable alternative to advanced non-linear programming methods. The manipulability generally exhibits relatively little variation when compared to space utilization. The tendency exists for the solution to converge on a zero workspace size architecture when manipulability is optimized alone. The inclusion of the space utilization index in the cost function is crucial for obtaining realistic design candidates.},

  abstract  = {New University of Western Australia Robot is a variation of the well-known Delta parallel robot. Parallel manipulators possess a number of advantages when compared to traditional serial arms. They offer generally much higher rigidity and smaller mobile mass than their serial counterparts. These features allow much faster and more precise manipulations. The main disadvantage of parallel robots is their small workspace in comparison to serial arms of similar size. Our previous work investigated the influence of motor axes orientation on the workspace volume of Delta type manipulators. This research has shown that the Delta configuration is not optimal and that the configuration characterized by <m:math display='block'>

This contribution presents NUWAR’s workspace volume and shape as well as results in kinematics of NUWAR. It was shown, that like for the Delta, there existed analytical closed form solutions of inverse as well as forward kinematics problems. Simulations of trajectories of various shapes (straight line, ellipse, sheared ellipse, cycloid, etc.) confirmed the appropriateness of methods used. The model of kinematics was implemented in the comprehensive Matlab simulation suite, which enables a user to specify trajectories in Cartesian or joint space, and conduct kinematic analyses of the manipulator. The NUWAR direct drive prototype was constructed and is now capable of achieving accelerations of 600 m/s2.},
